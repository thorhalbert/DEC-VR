# DEC-VR
Beginnings of Data Collection for building working VR Models of DEC Computers

Most did this because I have a collection of lots of pictures from older DEC computers (few taken by me, though a few).

Also, I made several PDP-11 (and KL-10) front panel drawings in inkscape that people were interested in, so thought I'd share.

Most of these pictures have been collected off the web over many years and were not taken by me.  

However, the 'My Drawings' directory contains PDP-11 console images that I created in inkscape and the 'Misc' libary has a few pictures of me surrounded by old machines.

I also have a vast pin-board on pinterest that I'll try to back up and put in here.
