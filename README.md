# DEC-VR
Beginnings of Data Collection for building working VR Models of DEC Computers

Most did this because I have a collection of lots of pictures from older DEC computers (few taken by me, though a few).

Also, I made several PDP-11 (and KL-10) front panel drawings in inkscape that people were interested in, so thought I'd share.
